# Bleeding Revamped

I makes:
1) small bleeding stop after a while. so killing bear with revolver shoot in the foot will be very unlikely.
2) moose bleed now, but in nearly most cases so little, that it is not enough to kill it.
3) bleeding now propaly stack. shooting wildlife more that one time will cause the bleeding rates to add. (in vanilla just the stronger one is used the other bleedings are ignorted O.o)
4) bleeding now causes condition loss. (in vanilla no HP are lost from bleeding O.o)
5) randomize the bleeding times a bit. so players can have luck and hit the aorta
6) Wildlife now slowly regens HP so wounds will disapear after some time.
